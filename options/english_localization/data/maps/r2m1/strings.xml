The destruction of the contamination source came as a shock to most people. Not everyone recovered from it: the radiation became too deeply rooted in human mind and body. In an attempt to repair the harm, the supercomputer began to infiltrate all spheres of human life. Numerous useful devices were rebuilt according to his blueprints. All sorts of robotic assistants were assigned to each survivor to help them with everything. However, the people did not accept the changes. Some of them refused to take the Oracle’s gifts and returned to their simple life. And ever more often someone would lament the disappearance of the voice incessantly whispering about the ascension."
