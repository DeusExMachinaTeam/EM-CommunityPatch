		id="r1_Firsy_History_00"
		value=" We’ve been taking our vegetables to the Sowth’s market for years. I’m not a bad driver, but father never let me go there on my own until today. But today is my birthday: I can do whatever I want! I bet dad is preparing a surprise for me and wants me to be out of his way for now. Well, I'm going to dive into big city life then!" />

	<string
		id="r1_Yes_Lisa_History_01"
		value=" I’ve had an unexpected encounter near the town. A good-looking girl asked me to help her. From the way she looked and carried herself, I suspected that she might be involved with a gang, but I agreed: you gotta trust people. There’s no harm in showing her around, is there?" />

	<string
		id="r1_No_Lisa_History_02"
		value=" I’ve had a strange encounter near the town. A good-looking girl asked me to help her. She looked and acted like she was from a gang, so I refused to help her deliver some suspicious-looking package, but I just can’t get her out of my mind. Anyway, it's time to get down to business, I've lost enough time as it is." />

	<string
		id="r1_Three_Villages_00"
		value=" What was my father going to tell me, I wonder? I’d better be going home now; I’ve stayed here way too long." />

	<string
		id="r1_First_Felix_Meet_00"
		value=" Damn bandits! They don't let you feel safe anywhere. Luckily, my truck may be old, but it's still very solid! I defeated Felix's bandits, but for some reason their threats of make me pay for it got under my skin." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Gloohoe_To_Ben_01"
		value=" I noticed the smoke over my village from a distance. A terrible thing happened: somebody killed all the people and burnt the village to the ground. Father was on the ground, his strength leaving his body, but before he passed away, he gave me what looked like a birthday gift. His last words were: &quot;Find Ben Throttle&quot;. I buried the dead people and went back to my truck. I opened the box and found dad’s savings, a sparkling object which looked like a disc and a sealed letter with my name on it." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Gloohoe_To_Felix_02"
		value=" I noticed the smoke over my village from a distance. A terrible thing happened: somebody killed all the people and burnt the village to the ground. No one survived to tell me who’s done it and why. But I know who to blame. The monster Felix kept his promise… there's only one thing left for me: revenge. I'll rally everyone to the war against the bandits!" />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Letter_00"
		value=" The letter said I was adopted and my true father was an explorer called Ivan Go. All that’s left from him is the truck I’m driving now and a mysterious disc of unknown utility. Ivan Go has gone missing many years ago and is probably dead by now. My world has just turned upside down. To get my feet back on the ground, I have to find out all about my real father! If he is alive, I will find him wherever he is and find out why he abandoned me. But first I have to talk to Ben Throttle." />

	<string
		id="r1_South_About_Felix_00"
		value=" Turns out, Felix has been raiding this area for a while now. He’s made a sort of agreement with farmers: they pay him in return for &quot;protection&quot;. This system worked fine until Glukhoe was destroyed. Most people are still too frightened to stand up openly against Felix, but I managed to get some help. With the powerful weapons offered by a kind man, I might be able to destroy his lair on my own." />

	<string
		id="r1_Before_Ben_00"
		value=" I had to travel a lot before I found out anything specific. I didn't realize that there were other towns and villages beyond my homeland. Finally, I was shown the way to Ben's place." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Ben_00"
		value=" The old man saw the familiar features in me and gave me a warm welcome. His house was full of strange objects. When I told him my story, he said my father has been gone for around 20 years. He found something important but didn’t want to tell anyone about it until he made sure it was safe. Ben told me a little about my father and his life as Explorer. When I showed him the disc, he recalled that my dad had a machine that could read and write such things, as if they were books. He gave me directions to my father’s house." />

	<string
		id="r1_Kill_Felix_00"
		value=" The bandits' base lies in ruins, Felix has fled with his tail between his legs. He wasn't the one responsible for my father's death, so I didn't have the guts to kill him in cold blood. He may be evil, but who am I to be his judge? The men who had destroyed the Glukhoe were far more powerful than this pack of scum. I realized it myself when I attacked their hideout, and the leader's words only confirmed my thinking. The only witness to the horrible crime was Lisa, a visitor from the north. Well, I'll find her and find out." />

	<string
		id="r1_Father_Room_00"
		value=" If Ben's home seemed strange to me, my father's dwelling was simply breathtaking. To me, though, all the strange contraptions that filled my father's house were just a heap of useless junk. All the machines seemed to be out of order. The humid air that penetrated the house through broken windows and roof is probably the reason. One thing drew my attention – a Charm of unusual shape, which I found in a stash when a board cracked underneath my feet." />

	<string
		id="r1_About_Lisa_After_Base_00"
		value=" The girl is not as simple as she lets on. She’s hanging out with bandits. I have a bad feeling about her. I’ve traveled so many miles after her and I’m beginning to understand what kind of bird she is." />

	<string
		id="r1_Dialod_With_Lisa_00"
		value=" How could I ever doubt the innocent creature? She was frightened and looking for help. Poor girl told me about Axel’s tyranny in Argen and his plans to spread his influence to the east. And my home village fell victim to it. I won’t rest until I have my revenge. I’ll get to Axel, whatever it takes." />

	<string
		id="r1_See_Tonnel_00"
		value=" The mercenaries use the tunnel, which starts near Asgard. This is a pretty dangerous place: I bet locals cooperate with the bandits and get their interest from arms traffic." />

	<string
		id="r2_After_Tonnel_00"
		value=" I got the key to the tunnel door and after several hours’ driving with my headlights on I found myself in a strange new place." />

	<string
		id="r2_Find_Lisa_00"
		value=" After my first meeting with the locals, I realized that the people here are far less civilized than my countrymen in Krai. However, I learned an interesting thing from them: that Lisa is Axel’s assistant. Axel is the leader of a gang based in Argen. | The gang is called Crimson Dawn, and it's a hell of a lot more than just a band of thugs. They’ve declared a war against Librium and that’s just a part of their ambitious plans. I don't think I can get to him alone." />

	<string
		id="r2_Find_Axel_00"
		value=" After my first meeting with the locals, I realized that the people here are far less civilized than my countrymen in Krai. Probably for the best: it will be easier to get to Axel unnoticed in all this chaos.| Turns out they have a government here, which is at war with the neighbor state. The trouble is, Axel is the leader of that state and is obviously well-guarded. I’ll have to use my brain to get to him." />

	<string
		id="r2_SNG_00"
		value=" I joined the CIT, the Commonwealth of Independent Towns – that’s what Librium people call themselves. I think that their fight against the invaders is a noble cause. Besides, we have a common enemy. Axel." />

	<string
		id="r2_AR_00"
		value=" The best way to get to Axel is probably to join his Crimson Dawn army. I’ll gain the commander’s respect and get presented for an award. And when I meet Axel in person, he's not going anywhere." />

	<string
		id="r2_Before_Axel_00"
		value=" That was a hell of a war. It wasn’t always direct, but it was always destructive. And I had to do things I’m probably going to regret. But I don’t have time for that now that Axel is almost in my hands." />

	<string
		id="r2_After_Axel_01"
		value=" I was bitterly disappointed after I defeated the Crimson Dawn leader. I expected to meet a barbarian, a ruthless killer, but before me stood an intellectual man, concerned about the future of the humankind. And even though I couldn’t accept his methods, I sort of liked him. Besides, he turned out to be innocent of the terrible crimes Lisa had accused him of. It seems, the demoness fooled us both. She’ll pay for it." />

	<string
		id="r2_After_Axel_02"
		value=" I was bitterly disappointed after I defeated the Crimson Dawn leader. I expected to meet a barbarian, a ruthless killer, but before me stood an intellectual man, concerned about the future of the humankind. And even though I couldn’t accept his methods, I sort of liked him. Especially since it turned out that Lisa kept him in the dark about her actions." />

	<string
		id="r2_Lisa_After_Axel_01"
		value=" Now that I knew where to look and had a reputation as a liberator, all I had to do was ask a few questions of the right people to find Lisa, who was hiding somewhere nearby. When I finally caught up with her, she managed to jump into her armored vehicle and give me a decent fight before I got the answers I needed." />

	<string
		id="r2_Lisa_After_Axel_02"
		value=" Now that I was a hero of Librium, I had no trouble tracking Lisa down and finally talking to her openly. It turned out that she was looking for Ivan Go, a famous explorer who had disappeared years ago. The trail led her to my home village, but it was too late: unknown attackers had come from the Desert of Death and destroyed all the evidence." />

	<string
		id="r2_With_Lisa_To_Oracul_01"
		value=" I will hunt down criminals, even if I have to travel to the edge of the earth. But no one has ever survived in the Desert of Death. They say the Oracle of the north island has all the answers. So Lisa and I are going to see him. Yes, she is coming with me, she had some kind of disc that contains important information about Ivan, but she couldn't find a way to decipher it." />

	<string
		id="r1_Before_Desert_00"
		value=" The masters of Midgard were happy to help me assemble the new device, but they lacked the necessary materials. Well, it won't be the first time I've done things like this - I had no trouble getting what was needed and, after paying for the work, I found myself in possession of a vehicle capable of enduring the hardships of the endless desert." />

	<string
		id="r1_Lisa_Thief_00"
		value=" My joy didn’t last. Lisa, an old acquaintance, has stolen both discs and the key to the Sea Gate! Her tracks lead to the west. I’ll follow her and ask her why she wants things that have no value to anyone but me." />

	<string
		id="r1_After_Boss1"
		value=" I never imagined such monsters existed, and today I came face to face with one of them. As it turned out, the way to the Sea Gate was guarded, but I managed to defeat the guard, though a couple of times I thought he was going to crush me." />

	<string
		id="r3_After_WaterGate_1"
		value=" When I finally reached the seashore, I immediately spotted the Sea Gate. It was a grand structure at the very edge of the firm ground. I approached it and lifted the Charm above my head, which felt warmer for some reason. The next thing I saw was a giant fish coming to the surface. The fish opened its mouth which looked big enough for two trucks to fit in, and froze as if inviting me to drive in. Terrified, I drove inside… The mouth closed and I heard a loud splash as the monster dived back into the sea depths.| The monster turned out to be a huge mechanism, like my truck." />

	<string
		id="r3_JustGo_1"
		value=" The region was truly exotic: huge trees and humid air stirred primal instincts in me." />

	<string
		id="r3_Fist_Fight_1"
		value=" The only road through the jungle led me to a small settlement. However, I was not welcomed there with much hospitality, so I had to withdraw with a fight and look for a more friendly settlement.| Luckily, I found it soon enough. The people of the other village gave me a warm welcome and offered an alliance against the aggressive Druids." />

	<string
		id="r3_Uluk_LureDruid"
		value=" I didn’t like the idea of an ambush, but I agreed to help the villagers nonetheless. In return for my help, the Machine-cultists showed me the way to the Oracle." />

	<string
		id="r3_Uluk_NoLureDruid"
		value=" I refused to take part in their bloody plan, so I headed towards the forest capital – Seth." />

	<string
		id="r3_Fist_Friendly"
		value=" The only road through the jungle led me to a small settlement. However, I was not met there with much hospitality, even though I managed to keep the misunderstanding under control. It turns out that only the High Druid from Seth knows the way to the Oracle, so I set off towards Seth." />

	<string
		id="r3_Set_HelpMainDruid_1"
		value=" The High Druid presented me with a difficult task, but a couple of steel monsters couldn't break my determination. I had to travel all over this godforsaken land to earn the old man's trust and find out where the Oracle was." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_FirstTime"
		value=" I had imagined a hermit's hut high in the mountains when the Oracle was spoken of, but what I saw was nothing like the stories of wizards and sages. A complex of towers connected by overhead passages, sparkling with dangerous energy, inside was a monster, apparently imprisoned in the golden cage by the warriors of the past. That’s how I first met the Oracle." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_HelpHim_1"
		value=" The Oracle asked for a favor in return for information. I had no option but to agree." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_DecodeDisc1"
		value=" The Oracle agreed to read the disc if I carry out certain rituals for him. Fair enough, I thought. And besides, the island was full of interesting places." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_NeedDisc2"
		value=" When the Oracle took the disc from me I froze with anticipation of what might be revealed to me. Imagine my disappointment when an emotionless voice declared: ‘Insert disc #2’! But I only had one! Which I expressed into the small window, punctuating my speech with exclamations and profanity. I couldn’t believe it! Were all my efforts in vain? The Oracle asked me calmly where I got the disc from and what I was trying to find out with its help. He told me to look for the second disc among my father’s things. My first impulse was to search the old truck my father left me." />

	<string
		id="r3_Oracle_BringDisc2"
		value=" With the disc and the Charm in my bag, I visited the Oracle again. My father’s message was finally deciphered! At long last I heard my father’s voice… He was talking about his life and research. Most importantly, I found out that his path was taking him across the desert in search of some important device. It must have been something top secret, since my dad hid his diary so well. I realized that my dad wanted me to hear these words and to know where he was heading, in case he couldn’t come back. I must find him!" />

	<string
		id="r3_v2_Uluk_FirstTime_1"
		value=" The only road through the jungle led me to a small settlement. The locals gave me a warm welcome and offered an alliance against the aggressive Druids." />

	<string
		id="r3_v2_LisaDisc1"
		value=" The Oracle couldn’t decipher Lisa’s disc, but he told me that there was a blueprint of a gadget that could help me cross the desert. " />

	<string
		id="r3_v2_BringDisc2"
		value=" With both discs in my hands, I returned to the Oracle and deciphered Ivan’s diary. Now all that's left is to gather the essentials for the journey across the desert." />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterSomeTimeTravel"
		value=" After many long days of driving under the scorching sun and sandy wind, I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw the clay buildings of Oasia.| But the people there are strange: one moment they are friendly, the next they are trying to stab you in the back. And the oddest thing is that everyone seems to be occupied with something, but no one can talk coherently about anything. It's as if everyone's memory is faded." />

	<string
		id="r4_KnownAboutBuhara"
		value=" I found out that there is a village of the Memory Keepers nearby – that’s what they call their elders. I must go there and find one sane person. I wonder, what happened here… This place looks like it survived a major cataclysm." />

	<string
		id="r4_FindBuhara"
		value=" It was with great difficulty that I managed to find a place lost in the desert among the hulks of huge ships, I'll give credit to the caution of its owners. One thing was unclear, why would the old men want to hide?" />

	<string
		id="r4_TalkWithBuhares"
		value=" My visit caused panic among Bukhara population. It was only when the Memory Keepers realized that I didn’t mean harm that they told me their grim story:| Many years ago a mysterious madness seized the people of local villages. They started killing each other, and worst of all, they had no memory of what they had done afterwards. Strangely, the plague did not affect the old people of Bukhara, although they lived in constant fear of attack. It came as a shock to me that there were no mysterious villains, but ordinary people were killing each other and destroying their own houses." />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterAtackToBuhars"
		value=" Now I understood why the elders tried so hard to hide their village. Following me, military vehicles arrived and opened fire on Bukhara from the cannons. I couldn’t let them kill innocent people! I remembered too well what happened to my own village. I fought until we destroyed the last vehicle and then helped to evacuate the elders on a ship. In return they told me that a man who fit the description of my father had once passed their village. He was looking for something and headed east. I’ll follow him!" />

	<string
		id="r4_LisaBecameCrazy"
		value=" There was something strange going on with Lisa the whole journey: first she became nervous, suspicious, and finally she opened fire on me. It was a real test of my humanity. But I realised that she was not a traitor, it was just the way this place was affecting her mentally.| When we reached Bukhara, the girl fainted. So I sent her to the mainland with the rest of the townsfolk so Ben could take care of her. I continued my search." />

	<string
		id="r4_FindFatherCar"
		value=" I soon found an old armored vehicle covered in sand, apparently damaged during the skirmish. There was no body inside, but I found a jacket with my father’s name on it. He’s been there! Looks like he’s left his truck and continued his journey on foot.| I took a few gadgets from the car – they were too good to be left here. They will remind me of my father. I’m sure I’m on the right way now. " />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterMilitaryBase"
		value=" Nothing prepared me for the encounter with the army of madmen. I was saved from the imminent death by unexpected allies. Science settlement, lost in the middle of the desert, and its weird master made a strange impression on me." />

	<string
		id="r4_NearTarelka"
		value=" Crossing the next dune, I saw a terrible sight: many people were standing motionless around a huge metal mountain. I couldn’t say whether they were dead or alive. I didn’t know why they gathered here but I felt, that Ivan Go was one of them. No one answered my cries and signals. A feeling of great sorrow came upon me." />

	<string
		id="r4_AfterTarelka"
		value=" I could almost feel the power coming from the centre of this circle, calling me to join the majority. I managed to resist it and return to the settlement. Here I learned about the catastrophe that destroyed the ancient world and its causes. Humans should not play with things that are beyond their comprehension! Now the extraterrestrial mechanism, triggered by the scientist keeps working and poisoning my planet.| There must be a way to stop this madness. It seems that Ivan Go had apparently encountered alien technology before. I should speak with his friend, Ben Throttle, about it." />

	<string
		id="r1_Before_Fight_Aliens"
		value=" My eyes are open. Evil alien invaders are terraforming our planet with the help of the huge emitter I found in the desert. But their main base is somewhere around Seil, a town in the Librium. Its radiation jams the Oracle’s signals. If I destroy the base, my mechanical ally will take control over the orbital weapon and launch nuclear strikes that will stop the invasion for good!" />

	<string
		id="r2_Before_Fight_Oracle"
		value=" I met one of the aliens, Njeri, as they call themselves. Now I now what really happened in the past. The Catastrophe was caused by a chain of tragic incidents that triggered a mechanism that was not designed to operate in the vicinity of living beings. Even the Njeri themselves can't get close enough to it. But I've been there once before and survived, which means I can stop the emitter. And I will do it!" />

	<string

Here I learned about the catastrophe that destroyed the ancient world and its causes. Humans should not play with things that are beyond their comprehension! Now the extraterrestrial mechanism, triggered by the scientist keeps working and poisoning my planet.| I must destroy this place along with its horrors and mysteries. Oracle probably knows where to find a powerful enough weapon." />

	<string
		id="r3_AfterKillMonster"
		value=" I never imagined such monsters existed, and today I came face to face with one of them. As it turned out, the way to the Oracle’s island was guarded, but I managed to defeat the guard, though a couple of times I thought he was going to crush me." />
