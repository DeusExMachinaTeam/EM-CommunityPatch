# About ComRem and ComPatch

![ComRem main menu Screen shot][screenshot_mainmenu]
*On the screenshot is the main menu of Community Remaster*<br /><br />

&#128312;**Community Patch** - a base version suitable for those playing on PCs with 4:3 screens and wanting to get as close to the original experience as possible:
* improves game stability, significantly reduces the number of game crashes
* fixes lag/freeze on spawning enemy vehicles
* fixes story related bugs, cutscenes and quests
* restores small chunk of cut vanilla-friendly content
* improves driving physics, removes "Moon gravity"
* fixes the wide FOV broken in the original game
* increases maximum render distance
* fixes model and animation bugs

&#128992; **Community Remaster** - extension of Community Patch, ideal for PCs with widescreens. In addition to all the fixes of ComPatch, also:
* the game interface was redesigned to fully support 16:9 resolutions up to 4K
* added new, high quality models and animations for some weapons and cars, more paint choices for HD vehicles
* improved graphics, shaders, some textures of the original game
* the author of the original soundtrack recorded a remaster of some of the music

...and many other changes!

An exhaustive list is available when installing using ComMod mod manager or in the file [change_list_eng.md on Github](https://github.com/DeusExMachinaTeam/EM-CommunityPatch/blob/main/change_list_eng.md)

</br>

&#x1F53B; Important! &#x1F53B;
* Community Patch / Remaster installation is possible **only on no-DRM version 1.02** and only with ComMod mod manager! This is necessary because we apply binary patches directly to game's executable, and all the available changes are possible only with 1.02. **We recommend to use Russian Steam version for installation, you can switch your copy to Russian before the installation of English ComRemaster/Patch from Steam's game settings**. Another option: unpacked version from the official Russian "Ex Machina Anthology".
* Community Patch / Remaster can be installed **only on 64 bit versions of Windows 8, 10 or 11**!

# Installation
## Quick install guide
In general, there is nothing difficult about the installation of ComRem/Patch and its compatible mods.

* Download the archive with the mod and ComMod mod manager, do not manually unpack the archive

* Create a folder where the mod manager and its files will be stored.

* Run the mod manager ![DeusExMachina logo][dem_logo_sml] **commod.exe**, at the settings screen specify the folder where the mod manager files will be stored ( like mods), this can be the same folder where you put commod.exe 

* Specify the path to the unpacked game of version 1.02. If you installed the game from Steam, you can select it from the list of automatically found copies of the game. Don't forget to switch the game to Russian in the game's settings on Steam before attempting the installation!

* Add the downloaded archive of Community Remaster/Patch to your mod library on the local mods page of ComMod. (If you unzipped the archive, you can manually copy the unzipped folder to the "mods" folder that appeared in the ComMod's file storage path you selected earlier)

* Click "Extract", then "Install" - select the variant and options you like.

After installation, you can run the game from ComMod's launch page, but also from Steam or from shortcut.

Installation of other mods compatible with ComMod and Community Remaster/Patch is carried out in the same way.

</br>
&#x1F53B; Important! &#x1F53B;
<ol>
<b>commod.exe</b> is an installer and mod manager that can cause false positives for antiviruses.
In the work process, the installer patches the original exe of the game byte by byte, copies the patch\remaster files in the correct order, and also edits some game files directly. Unfortunately, both the specifics of it's function (editing another exe) and the fact that the installer is written in Python means that you may need to add the file to your antivirus exceptions. We apologize for any inconvenience, the file does not contain any viruses.
