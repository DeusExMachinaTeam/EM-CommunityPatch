All usage cases for model vagon3.gam with missing collision were replaced with analogous model which has collision(rr_vagon4.gam)

* If player successfully crosses the swamp while being on Lisa's root, after the death of the boss there is a new check of having a quest that is exclusive for Lisa's root, to prevent player activating the passage to Sacred Grove in place where story shouldn't allow that
